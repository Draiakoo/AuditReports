# About Draiakoo
I'm currently sharpening my auditing skills by competing in different audit contest plaforms. You can find me at [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/@Draiakoo) and [Codehawks](https://www.codehawks.com/profile/clk3xadrc0020l808t9unuqkr).

My current plan is to grind these 2 platforms to climb in their ladder. After that I may expand to other plaforms like Sherlock and Cantina.

If you would like a private audit or any consulting service you can reach me out on **Twitter** ([@Draiakoo](https://twitter.com/Draiakoo))
