# About Draiakoo
I am a passionate Web3 security researcher specializing in identifying vulnerabilities across decentralized protocols and smart contracts. With a deep commitment to ensuring the safety of user funds, I actively participate in public audit contests on prominent platforms such as Code4rena, Cantina, and Codehawks. I also collaborate with renowned audit firms to enhance the quality and accuracy of their reports for their private audits. My goal is always to provide the highest value to the protocols, using my current knowledge and expertise.

I am ranked 1st on the all-time leaderboard at Codehawks and 2nd as a judge, helping assess and guide other participants' contributions.

Over the course of almost 2 years of competing, I have been rewarded with over $300 000 from audit contests. Below, you can find a breakdown of all the security competitions I’ve participated in, including relevant information on each. Additionally, you can find my experience with bug bounties and private audits.

You can find me on [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/@Draiakoo), [Codehawks](https://profiles.cyfrin.io/u/draiakoo), [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/u/Draiakoo), and [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/profile/Draiakoo/).
