# About Draiakoo
I am a passionate Web3 security researcher specializing in identifying vulnerabilities across decentralized protocols and smart contracts. With a deep commitment to ensuring the safety of user funds, I actively participate in public audit contests on prominent platforms such as Code4rena, Cantina, and Codehawks. My goal is always to provide the highest value to the protocols, using my current knowledge and expertise.

I have been ranked 7th on the all-time leaderboard at Codehawks and 2nd as a judge, helping assess and guide other participants' contributions.

Over the course of more than a year of competing, I have been rewarded with over $60000. Below, you can find a breakdown of all the security competitions I’ve participated in, including relevant information on each.

You can find me on [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/@Draiakoo), [Codehawks](https://profiles.cyfrin.io/u/draiakoo), [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/u/Draiakoo), and [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/profile/Draiakoo/).
